# FaceRecognition-Web-App

The FaceRecognition-Web-App is built in `React` and is an awesome utility to detect faces in images. It uses an API to detect faces in images. <br>
You can visit the application [here](http://facereco-smart-brain.herokuapp.com/)

### Login Page
On visiting, the first interface which you will get is shown below:
![Login Page](/public/img/login.png)

From here, you will have to `login`(if you are an existing user) or `register`(if you are a new user). Let's say you registered here. Then application will automatically log you in and will redirect you to the main landing page of the website.

### Landing Page
The main landing page of the website will look like this:
![Landing Page](/public/img/landing.png)

Here, you can see an input box in the middle of the page which is asking for `image URL` whose face to be detected. The background has an awesome UI containing `ParticleJS` and a transition.

### Face Detection
After entering the URL and clicking the detect button, you will get your output as shown below:
![Output](/public/img/face.png)

It is clearly visible that the output has a detected face.
